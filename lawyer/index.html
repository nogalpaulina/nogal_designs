                    <p class="section-paragraph">federal and state constitutions and statutes. Among our civil rights is the freedom of speech and religion, freedom from unreasonable government intrusions, right to bear arms, right to make contracts, right to a speedy trial, right to due process, right to vote, and right to equal protection. However, certain exceptions to our civil rights are permitted. An unlawful violation of a civil right is cause to seek an attorney to file an action for damages or some other relief.</p>
